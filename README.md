# python-challenge

In this challenge we were able to analyze two different data sets and break them down using python to obtain crucial information 

-- PyBank 
In this analysis, we will examine the financial records of a company, encompassing a series of monthly profit and loss data. By processing this data, we aim to distill key financial metrics that offer insights into the company's performance over the recorded period. The analysis includes calculating:

    - Total of months in our data set
    - Net total of profit and losses
    - Average change
    - Greatest increase and decrease period (date and amount)
    
In our "Analysis" folder we can see the results of this analysis, using python as our tool. 
This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the financial performance of the company over the recorded period. By identifying key metrics such as total months, net total, average change, and periods of greatest increase and decrease in profits, we can gain valuable insight into the company's financial health and trends. 


-- PyPoll
We are helping a small town to modernize its voting process using Python.

To complete this task we are analyzing a large set of data where we find the "Voter ID", "County", "Candidate".

The results we are looking for are pretty simple

  - Total votes
  - Votes per candidate with percentages
  - Final winner
  
In our "Analysis" folder we can find the different outputs out off this data set
